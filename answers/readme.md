### Intro
1. The three pillars are Mathematical, Physical, Psychological

### Elementary Physics
1. Energy is a constant. It can transform into other energy but it can never increase or decrease.
2. Energy is measured in Joules.
3. Force is energy's attempt to move.
4. Force is measured in Newtons.
5. When force is applied to a surface, that surface experiences pressure.
6. Pressure is measured in Pascals.
7. E, F, N, J, p, Pa.
8. 1 atmosphere is 101325 Pa. We measure acoustic pressure relative to this.
9. p = F/A; Pa = 1N/m^2
10. _W_ = Î” E
11. Sound can be seen as flowing energy, beginning at the source and spreading throughout the farthest reaches of the system until it becomes heat.

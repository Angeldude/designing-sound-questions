Here I will be listing the answers. If you want to use this, I encourage you to attempt to answer the questions before looking in here.

### Intro
1. The three pillars are Mathematical, Physical, Psychological

### Elementary Physics
1. Energy is a constant. It can transform into other energy but it can never increase or decrease.
2. Energy is measured in Joules.
3. Force is energy's attempt to move.
4. Force is measured in Newtons.
5. When force is applied to a surface, that surface experiences pressure.
6. Pressure is measured in Pascals.
7. _E_, F, N, J, p, Pa.
8. 1 atmosphere is 101325 Pa. We measure acoustic pressure relative to this.
9. p = F/A; Pa = 1N/m^2; m is meters
10. _W_ = Î” _E_
11. Sound can be seen as flowing energy, beginning at the source and spreading throughout the farthest reaches of the system until it becomes heat.
12. Power is measured in Watts(W). Power is the rate of changing energy. 1 Watt is equal to 1J per second. Since changing energy = work, Power can be said to be the rate of work.
13. Most of our energy comes from the Sun and the fission deep inside our planet. Plants convert that energy into their own kind, leaves, branches, etc. This is an example of _W_ or changing energy. _E_ always moves to where there is less energy, or more degrees of freedom, to spread itself thin. 2nd Law of Thermodynamics
